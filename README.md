## Component Estimates
Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.


| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Getting api | H | 2hrs| 0min | 0mins |
| Create components | H | 2hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
